Bike speed controller is based on Espressif esp32 chip.
Connectivity between bike module and app runs via BLE.

App sends to esp32:

-	"1" coded in base64 in order tp shift the gear down
-	"2" coded in base64 in order tp shift the gear up


As the connection is estabilished, esp32 performs 4-time down shifting do obtain 
default "0" gear - so training always start at the lowest gear.

Gears are being shifted by providing LOW state (GND) on 

GPIO 18 --> which corresponds to pin that increases gear
GPIO 19 --> which corresponds to pin that decreases gear

Default is HIGH state on both pins ( 3.3V ).

Default duration of pulse is: 100 ms.

Default BLE device name is: "cardioVelo Bike"

Compiled binary available for ESP DevModule.
